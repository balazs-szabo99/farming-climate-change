# Farming Climate Change Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This app aims to provide a representation of the impact of climate change on agriculture and vice-versa. By combining climate change data with interactive and informative visualizations, the goal is to increase awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by the farming industry.
